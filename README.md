ðŸŒŽ I'm passionate about writing code and developing software that makes a positive impact in the world. Some of my projects include an SMS based service that uses blockchain to facilitate micro financing for small economies and a platform that allows small businesses to economically collect statistics in order to save money and optimize their workflows.
